VSDupes
=======
A quick Node script to find duplicate files from a given directory.

Usage:

    git clone [url]
    npm run build
    node index.js [path]

Remarks
-------
I originally wrote this because I thought [jdupes](https://github.com/jbruchon/jdupes)
was slow and I could write a faster implementation. Turns out I can't. :)

So in a nutshell, use jdupes.

I'll leave this here as an example of how one could implement duplicate checker with
relatively small amount of code.
